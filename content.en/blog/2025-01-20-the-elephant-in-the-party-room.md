Do you know this? In everyday life, we pay meticulous attention to waste separation, buy fair trade products and cycle to work. But as soon as a party, wedding or company event comes up, the issue of sustainability suddenly seems to take a back seat. Mountains of disposable tableware, unnecessary waste and high energy consumption are often the result.

Why is this the case? Perhaps we think “this one time won't make any difference”. Wrong! Especially at events where many people come together, the ecological footprint increases. A single paper cup may seem insignificant, but hundreds or even thousands quickly add up to a huge mountain of waste.

In our many years of experience as event caterers, we have seen this time and again: As soon as the topic of sustainability is put on the table, awareness grows. Conversations with guests have shown that many are quite willing to make more environmentally friendly choices - if they are given the opportunity to do so.

It is all the more important to pay attention to sustainability at events too, because:

- **The quantity counts:** As already mentioned, consumption and thus the consumption of resources multiplies at events.
- **Role model effect:** Events have great appeal. If sustainability is practiced here, it can send a strong signal and inspire others.
- **Future perspective:** A sustainable event culture is essential to preserve our planet for future generations.

Let's address the elephant in the party room together and make sustainability an integral part of every event!
