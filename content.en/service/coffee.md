  - title: Organic milk & alternatives
    md: We always work with regional organic milk, as well as a high-quality oat milk, which should not be missing on any coffee menu. We also have lactose-free milk as standard. If you would like a more exotic alternative, such as coconut or almond, we can of course also organize this for you in advance.
  - title: Italian Slow Coffee
    md: Our coffee beans embody the Italian coffee tradition, crafted with care and high-quality production in a family-owned business in Tuscany. They deliver the perfect taste for your event.
  - title: High-quality portafilter machines
    md: The centerpieces of our mobile coffee bars are our high-quality portafilter machines. Depending on space requirements, rush and, of course, stand design, we can offer a wide range of options. From the classic Italian hand lever machine to the multi boiler moderne La Marzocco, there are various great options available.
  - title: Easy Set-up
    md: Our coffee bars are quickly assembled and don't require a fixed water supply. Perfect for any location and event.
  - title: Coffee crockery or reusable cups
