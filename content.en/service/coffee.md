- title: Passionate baristas
  content: We love our job and you should feel that in your cup! Our baristas are proactive and always do their best to spoil you and your guests with delicious hot drinks.
- title: Coffee specialities & more
  content: In addition to specialty coffees such as espresso, cappuccino, flat white etc., guests who are not caffeine lovers are of course also catered for. Hot chocolate, various teas and matcha latte are also part of our repertoire.
- title: Organic milk & alternatives
  content: We always work with regional organic milk, as well as a high-quality oat milk, which should not be missing on any coffee menu. We also have lactose-free milk as standard. If you would like a more exotic alternative, such as coconut or almond, we can of course also organize this for you in advance.
- title: Italian Slow Coffee
  content: Our coffee beans embody the Italian coffee tradition, crafted with care and high-quality production in a family-owned business in Tuscany. They deliver the perfect taste for your event.
- title: High-quality portafilter machines
  content: The centerpieces of our mobile coffee bars are our high-quality portafilter machines. Depending on space requirements, rush and, of course, stand design, we can offer a wide range of options. From the classic Italian hand lever machine to the multi boiler moderne La Marzocco, there are various great options available.
- title: Easy Set-up
  content: Our coffee bars are quickly assembled and don't require a fixed water supply. Perfect for any location and event.
- title: Coffee crockery or reusable cups
  content: We have beautiful Portuguese coffee crockery & reusable To-Go cups in our stock. Due to our philosophy of sustainability, we always try to avoid disposable cups - and if this is not possible, we try to compensate.
