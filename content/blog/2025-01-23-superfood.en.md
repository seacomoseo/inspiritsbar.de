Superfood is on everyone's lips. Exotic names like chia, quinoa, or goji adorn the shelves and promise true miracles. But what is really behind the hype? And do we always need the distant exotics?

The term "superfood" is not actually a scientific definition, but rather a marketing term. It describes foods with a particularly high content of certain nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, or secondary plant substances. These nutrients can have positive effects on our health.

The problem: Many of the products advertised as superfoods come from far away. Long transport routes burden the environment and can impair the nutrient content of the food. We often forget that our local cuisine is also full of "superheroes."

Because we also grow foods that are rich in valuable ingredients and can support us naturally. They are regional, seasonal, and often much cheaper than their exotic competitors.

Here are some examples of "local superfoods":

- **Berries (e.g., blueberries, raspberries, currants):** Rich in antioxidants that protect our cells.
- **Broccoli:** Provides vitamin C, K, and folic acid as well as valuable secondary plant substances.
- **Kale:** A true vitamin bomb with lots of vitamin K, C, and A as well as fiber.
- **Ginger:** Has anti-inflammatory effects, can help with nausea, and strengthens the immune system.
- **Flaxseeds:** Rich in omega-3 fatty acids and fiber, good for digestion.
- **Mint:** Refreshes, soothes the stomach, and can help with digestive problems.
- **Nuts (e.g., walnuts, hazelnuts):** Contain healthy fats, proteins, and minerals.
- **Beetroot (Red Beet):** Has blood pressure-lowering and anti-inflammatory effects.

The list could go on and on. The important thing is: a balanced diet with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables is the best basis for good health. The "local superfoods" can optimally support us in this.

So why wander far afield when good things are so close? By focusing on regional and seasonal products, we not only do something good for our health, but also protect the environment and support local agriculture.
