Cocktails are more than drinks---they're part of culture, enjoyment, and lifestyle. Classics like the Negroni, Margarita, and Mojito are among the most ordered worldwide.

At [Inspirits Bar](/en/), the goal is not just to serve well-known recipes but to reinterpret these classics with creativity, quality, and innovative bar concepts. The result is cocktails that delight guests at any event.

## Which classics dominate the rankings?

The cocktails most frequently cited as favorites typically include:

- **Negroni cocktail:** an Italian aperitif with gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth. Its perfect balance of bitterness, sweetness, and herbal notes makes it a stylish way to start the evening.
- **Old fashioned cocktail:** purist, strong, and elegant. Whiskey (often bourbon or rye), sugar, bitters, and a piece of orange or citrus peel define its character.
- **Margarita cocktail:** fresh, citrusy, and ideal for sunny days. Tequila, lime juice, and triple sec (or Cointreau), plus a salted rim, deliver its signature kick.
- **Mojito cocktail:** refreshing and fizzy with mint, lime, white rum, and soda. A staple for summer evenings.
- **Espresso martini cocktail:** a modern classic that blends coffee and elegance. Perfect after dinner or as a little pick-me-up later in the evening.

## Why are these cocktails so popular?

There are many reasons for their popularity:

- **Balance and recognizability:** their flavor profiles are well balanced---not too sweet, not too strong---and you know exactly what you're getting.
- **Cultural reach:** many of these cocktails are popular not only in big-city bars but are offered in many countries around the world.
- **Adaptability:** many classics lend themselves to variation---with special sugar syrups, premium rum, or distinctive garnishes.
- **Occasion and mood:** a mojito suits summer, an old fashioned suits a cozy evening, and an espresso martini is great as a finale. The choice often depends on what fits the mood.

## Some lesser-known favorites and trends

Alongside the big classics, there are drinks that enjoy strong popularity in certain circles:

- **Penicillin:** whisky, honey, ginger, and lemon combined.
- **Tom Collins:** a light gin drink with lemon and soda.
- **Aperol spritz:** extremely popular when transitioning from day to evening thanks to its freshness and lightness.
- **Southside:** mint, gin, and lime---similarly refreshing to a mojito but with gin instead of rum.

These drinks show that variety is in demand and that trends---such as non-alcoholic versions or exotic ingredients---are gaining influence.

There isn't a single "most popular" cocktail, but classics like the Negroni, Old fashioned, Margarita, Mojito, and Espresso martini are certainly among the top favorites worldwide. What really matters is when and where they're enjoyed---occasion, weather, audience, and mood all influence which drink someone chooses.
